## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Built With

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**

## üíæ Data Management

### Where is data stored?

Currently, all data is stored **in browser memory** (`customerInsights` array in JavaScript). This means:

- ‚úÖ **Pros**: No setup required, works immediately
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Cons**: Data is lost when page refreshes

### Data Structure

Each customer interaction is stored as:

```javascript
{
  id: 1629123456789,              // Unique timestamp ID
  customerName: "John Doe",        // Customer identifier
  interactionType: "email",        // Type of interaction
  description: "Login issues...",   // Issue description
  tags: ["technical", "account"],   // Selected categories
  date: "2024-08-20T10:30:00Z"    // ISO date string
}
```

### Accessing the Data

You can access the data through browser console:

1. **Open Developer Tools** (F12 in most browsers)
2. **Go to Console tab**
3. **Type**: `customerInsights` and press Enter
4. **View all data**: This shows the complete array

### Export Data (Manual)

To manually export your data:

```javascript
// In browser console:
console.log(JSON.stringify(customerInsights, null, 2));
// Copy the output to save as JSON file
```
